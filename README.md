# Net
A clone of Simon Tatham's game at https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/net.html programmed in C. 

Just run the makefile to compile it. The game runs through command line, but doesn't work right now. The function to initially generate a completed grid is not implemented yet, but everything else is.
